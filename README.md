# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all her transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms. Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms. Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for these requirements, Ms. Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

An example of the data stored is 

| Date | Description | Category | Amount  |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Sep 23 2022 | bought a house | Expenses | 10 BTC |
| Sep 24 2022 | food for house celebration | Food | 0.000001 BTC |

## Proposed Solution
I will design and make a digital ledger for Ms. Sato, a client who is in need of a way to track her cryptocurrency transactions. The digital ledger will be about storing data of transactions and generating/displaying statistics, and is constructed using the software Python in the IDE PyCharm. It will take approximately a month to complete and will be evaluated according to the success criteria listed below.

The client has allowed the developer to select a type of cryptocurrency to focus on. Therefore, I picked the currency Dai.

Dai is a cryptocurrency operated by MakerDAO, created in December 2017. Dai aims to bring stability to the cryptocurrency economy as an unbiased, decentralized stablecoin. (“The Maker Protocol: MakerDAO's Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) System”, makerdao.com, https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper) 1 Dai is approximately pegged to $1 USD, making it an advantage for users who want to avoid the high volatility of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum. Dai can be generated by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults in the Maker Protocol, which creates liquidity for users. Being run by an Decentralized Autonomous Organization, there is no central government. This can be an advantage for users who prefer to trust democratic governance for financial systems. All Dai transactions can also be publicly viewed on the Ethereum blockchain, promoting transparency for the currency. (“What Is DAI Coin and Why Is It Special?”, originstamp.com, https://originstamp.com/blog/what-is-dai-coin-and-why-is-it-special/) Overall, Dai is a cryptocurrency valued for its high stability, freedom, and transparency.

I will be making the digital ledger using Python. First, the readability of Python's due to its simple syntax makes maintenance and updates to the ledger easy, and minimal-cost. The reusability of code in Python would make the creation of new, but similar or improved functions efficient. Secondly, Python’s support of modules, packages, and libraries help simplify complicated functions that can be useful in achieving a desirable ledger for the client. Some examples include datetime to record the date of transactions, csv to store these transactions in a database, pandas to analyze data, and maskpass to hide password inputs in the terminal. (“What is Python? Executive Summary”, python.org, https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected. 
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger can display statistics such as profit, total spendings, total earnings, and balance.
5. The electronic ledger organizes transactions based on categories such as "Expenses," "Food," "Clothes," etc.
6. The electronic ledger can display all transactions made in a specified month of a specified year.

Success criterias 1, 2, and 3 are pre-determined success criterias as per the client's request.

Success criteria 4 is relevant to the client's needs, as in the problem definition, it is stated that "Ms. Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics." I interpreted useful statistics as data such as incomes, expenditures, total gain, and total loss. It is also stated she needs to track the amount of cryptocurrency, therefore the current balance she has is another statistic that should be displayed.

Success criteria 5 is relevant to the client's needs as in the problem definition, an exmple of how the client has been storing data is shared. Currently, the client is storing data on each transaction in the format of date, description, category, and amount. Therefore, to make it easier for the client to adapt to using my application, my digital ledger should be able to categorize the client's transactions into similar sorts of categories.

Success criteria 6 is relevant to the client's needs, as in the problem definition, it is stated that it is "difficult for Ms. Sato to find past transactions." Therefore, a feature that easily locates and display past transactions would be a useful feature for the client. Many people tend to finance their money by month, therefore I chose that the ledger should be able to display all transactions from a specified month in a specified year.

Although a feature that can calculate the rate of Dai to the USD can be useful, it is not as important as other features due to the nature of Dai being soft-pegged to the value of USD. As the difference in the value of 1 Dai and $1 USD is at any time practically negligible, a calculation is barely ever required.

# Criteria C: Development
## Displaying a menu, and validating a user choice from the menu
To start, I thought that it would be good to have a method for printing out a menu given the different choices the program wants to give to the user, and then a function that will prompt the user to choose from one of the options.

To create this, I first made a function using a for loop that will print a simple menu.
```.py
def display_menu(choices: list):
    """Displays a menu with choices from a list.
    :param choices: list containing strings of choices in a menu
    """

    menu = ''
    count = 1
    for it in choices:
        menu += f"{it.ljust(50, '.')} type {count}\n"
        count += 1
    print(menu)
```
In the first line of code, I define the function display_menu, whihc takes a list choices, as a parameter. Next, I create a new empty string stored as the variable menu. In the next line, I create a variable called count which stores an integer, starting with 1. Next, using a for loop, the program will loop through each of the items in the given list. Each of the items in the list should be the options to be desplayed to the user, therefore in each loop, I add a new line to the menu variable containing the option, justified to the side, and a number assigned to correspond to that option, the count variable. Once the for loop has looped through every item in the list, it will print the menu variable which should now contain a menu of each of the options available to the user.

Next, I created a function that will validate user inputs from when they make a choice from the options in the displayed menu. I did this using while loops and if statements.
```.py
def validate_selection(choices: list) -> int:
    """Takes a list and a int user input, checks if the user input is within the number of choices available in the menu. Returns the int selection.
    :param choices: list
        A list containing strings of choices in a menu
    :return: int
        The final selection of user as an integer corresponding to the choices in list
    """

    expect = len(choices)
    select = input(f'Select a choice between 1~{expect}: ')
    while not select.isnumeric():
        select = input(f"Error. Please select a choice between 1~{expect}: ")
    while True:
        if not select.isnumeric() or not 0 < int(select) < expect + 1:
            select = input(f"Error. Please select a choice between 1~{expect}: ")
        else:
            break
    select = int(select)
    return select
```
In the first line, I define the function validate_selection, which takes the parameter choices which is a list, and returns an integer, In the next line, I create a variable expect, which represents the range of numbers the program is expecting from the user. In this case, it is the length of the list of choices, and hence the program expects the user to choose an option between the first option in the list and the last option in the list. In the next line, I create a variable select, which stores the user's input to a prompt asking them for the number corresponding to the choice they would like to make (as per the displayed menu's format). The program then checks using a while loop if select is a numeric value, or if the integer value of select is within the expected values. While either is False, the program will keep prompting the user's input for a numeric choice between the expected options and newly storing it as select until both conditions turn True. Once the if statement is True, it will go to the else statement, which prompts the for loop to break. Select is then converted into an integer before being returned from the function.

## Create New User Function
It would be beneficial for the client if they can create multiple accounts: this way, they could share with the product their family members, or finance their personal and work expenditures separately. I created this function by using csv files, while loops, and if statements.
```.py
print("[Create New User]")
with open('users.csv', mode='r') as users_list:
    users_database = users_list.readlines()
new_name = input("Create an alphanumeric username: ")
while not new_name.isalnum():
    new_name = input("Error. Please enter a username that is alphanumeric: ")
if users_database:  # if users_database is not empty
    validate = True
    while validate:
        for user in users_database:
            if new_name in user:
                new_name = input("Username already taken. Please enter another username: ")
            else:
                validate = False

new_pass = input("Create an alphanumeric password: ")
while not new_pass.isalnum():
    new_pass = input("Error. Please enter a password that is alphanumeric: ")
confirm_new_pass = input("Confirm new password: ")
while True:
    if confirm_new_pass != new_pass:
        new_pass = input("Passwords do not match. Create a password: ")
        confirm_new_pass = input("Confirm new password: ")
    else:
        break

with open('users.csv', mode='a') as users_list:
    writer = csv.writer(users_list)
    writer.writerow([new_name, new_pass])
with open(f"{new_name}.csv", mode='a') as user_data:
    writer = csv.writer(user_data)
    writer.writerow([datetime.date.today(), 0, "other"])
print("New User Successfully Created. Please log-in.")
```
In the first line, I print a header to let the user know that they will be creating a new user. In the next line, I use the open function from the csv module to open the file users.csv. mode='r' states that the program will only be reading the contents of the file. The csv is represented as users_list. Next, a variable users_database is created, which is a list where each item is each line of the csv file as a string. The program then prompts the user to create a username, and stores it in the variable new_name. Then, the program checks using a while loop that new_name is alphanumeric. While new_name is not alphanumeric, the program will keep prompting the user to create a new alphanumeric username and store it as new_name. When new_name is alphanumeric, the while loop finishes and the program moves on to the next line. In the next line, using an if statement, the program checks if users_database is empty. This is important as I wanted to use a while loop to loop through each line in users_databse. However, if users_database is empty, it is not possible for the program to loop through no items, therefore it will create an error. Having nothing in users_database means that there are no previous users, therefore there is also no need for the program to check if the user's newly created username new_name is already taken by another user. Should users_database be empty, the program skips the entire if statement. However, if users_database is not empty, it will run the contents of the if statement. In the if statement, a boolean variable validate is set as True. Next, I created a while loop for while validate is True. While validate, a for loop loops between each line (user) in users_database. It then checks using an if statement if new_name is in user. If True, it means that the newly created username already exists, therefore the program will prompt the user to create a new username and stores it as new_name. If False, the username is not taken, therefore validate is switched to False and the for loop ends.

In the next section, the user creates a new password. First, the user is prompted to create a new password which is stored as a new variable new_pass. Then, using a while loop, the program checks if new_pass is alphanumeric. While new_pass is not alphanumeric, the program will keep asking for an alphanumeric password and stores it in new_pass. When new_pass is alphanumeric, the for loop ends. Next, the user is asked to confirm their new password. Their input is stored as the variable confirm_new_pass. In a while True loop, I used an if statement to check if new_pass is the same as confirm_new_pass. If False, the program asks again for a new password, storing it in new_pass, and another confirmation, storing it in confirm_new_pass. The while loop will keep doing this process until new_pass is equal to confirm_new_pass and the if statement outputs True. If True, the loop is broken, as per the else statement.

Now that all of the required information is provided, I use the csv module again to add this information into the database. Using the open function I open the file users.csv again. mode='a' states that the program can now append to the file (now called as users_list). The function csv.writer() states that the program will now write onto users_list, and writer.writerow() writes the variable new_name and new_pass two comma separated values in a row of the file. Using the same method, I then open a csv file new_name.csv in the same mode='a' as user_data. As this is a new user, for the first time, the function creates a new csv file of the name specified. As I want to use this csv file to store the user's transaction data, I write a row on the file containing today's date (datetime.date.today() from the datetime module returns today's date in the format year-month-day), 0 (the amount of DAI the user has), and "other". Once this is done, a message is printed to let the user know that the program has recorded them as a new user, and that the process is finished.

## Logging-in to the Wallet
Once a user is created, it should be required to log-in to their account for better privacy and security. Therefore I made a function to check if a user can log-in to their wallet, using the csv module, for loops, and if statements. 
```.py
def try_login() -> tuple:
    """Takes user input for username and password, and checks if the username and password is in one line in users.csv. Returns a tuple containing a bool and a str.
    :return: tuple
        A tuple containing a bool and a str. The bool is True if the username and password exist together, and False if the username and password do not match existing data. The str is the username of the user.
    """

    print("[Log-in]")
    with open('users.csv', mode='r') as f:
        data = f.readlines()
    success = False

    in_name = input("Enter your username: ")
    in_pass = input("Enter your password: ")

    for line in data:
        uname = line.split(',')[0]
        upass = line.split(',')[1].strip()  # strip() removes \n for any string unless specified

        if uname == in_name and upass == in_pass:
            success = True
            break

    return success, uname
```
In the first line, I define the function try_login, which returns a tupe containing a boolean and string. In the next line, I print a short header to show the user that they will now be logging in to their account. Next, using the open function from the csv module, I open users.csv which contains the usernames of all of the users registered on the product and the passwords to each of the usernames. The code mode='r' specifies that the program will only read the contents of the file. In the next line, the content of each line is saved as a list in the variable data, using the readlines function. Next, the program will use the data obtained in the previous lines to determine if the user may now log-in to the ledger or not. First, a new variable success, representing whether the current session user has successfully logged into an account or not is stored as a boolean, False. Then, a user input prompting the user for a username is stored as the variable in_name. A user input prompting the user for the corresponding password is stored as the variable in_pass.
Next, I use a for loop to check if the current user can log-in. The for loop loops between every line (string) in data (list) defined above. For every line, using the split function, the program splits the line by ',' and stores the 0 index value as the uname variable, and the 1 index value as the upass variable. (The upass variable needs the strip() function, as it is the end of a line in the csv file, and hence '\n' representing the start of a new line is at the end of the string. The strip() function removes the '\n'.) Then an if statement checks if uname is equal to in_name, and upass is equal to in_pass. When both comparisons are True, that means the user inputted username is the same as that being looped, and the password corresponding to that username has been correctly inputted. Therefore, success can be switched to True, and the for loop is broken. Otherwise, the program keeps looping through every pre-existing user in the database until it either finds an existing username that is the same as the user inputted username and its password is equal to that of the user inputted password, or it finishes looping through every existing user. The function finally returns success and the uname (which will be the user of the current session) as a tuple.

## Creating a New Transaction ((Success Criteria 3 & 5)
The electronic ledger should allow the user to enter, withdraw and record transactions. Therefore I created a function that allows the user to enter a new transaction to be recorded in the ledger. To achieve this, I used a combination of if statements and 

```.py
def create_transaction(select: int, name: str, categories: list):
    """Creates a new transaction and adds the transaction to the user's csv file.
    :param select: int
        The user's selection of transaction type
    :param name: str
        The username of the user of the current session
    :param categories: list
        A list containing strings of categories for deposits for the user to select from
    """
    action_date = datetime.date.today()
    if select == 1:  # User Create Transaction
        print("[New Deposit]")
        raw_dep = input("Enter amount of DAI you would like to deposit: ")
        while not validate_float(raw_dep):
            raw_dep = input("Error. Please enter how much DAI you would like to deposit: ")
        action_value = float(raw_dep)
        category = "deposit"
    if select == 2:
        print("[New Withdrawal]")
        raw_wtd = input("Enter amount of DAI you would like to withdraw: ")
        while not validate_float(raw_wtd):
            raw_dep = input("Error. Please enter how much DAI you would like to deposit: ")
        action_value = -(float(raw_wtd))
        print(sr)
        print("Select a Category for your Withdrawal:")
        display_menu(categories)
        category = categories[validate_selection(categories)-1].lower()

    with open(f"{name}.csv", 'a') as user_data:
        user_data.writelines(f"{action_date},{action_value},{category}\n")
    print(f"Transaction Recorded: On {action_date}, {action_value} DAI as {category} on {name}'s wallet.")
```

## Displaying Past Transactions (Success Criteria 6)
As per success criteria 6: The electronic ledger can display all transactions made in a specified month of a specified year, I created a function that allows for the user to select a month and year and then display all transactions during that period.

## Showing User Statistics (Success Criteria 4)
As per success criteria 4: The electronic ledger can display statistics such as profit, total spendings, total earnings, and balance, I made a program for the terminal to display these statistics to the user.

## Displaying a description of the cyrptocurrency (Success Criteria 2)
As per success criteria 2: The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected, in this section of the program, I coded a way for the user to be able to see the description of the DAI token.
